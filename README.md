Testing Instructions
====================

To deploy the templates through CLI, you could use the script deploy.sh. The default parameters file is the mainTemplateParameters.json. In order to test nestedtemplates, make sure they are publicly accessible by Azure and change the value of parameter '**_artifactsLocation**' to it

A example that deploy a standalone Sophos Firewall in a resource group with prefix 'sophostest0' and using the dev blob 'SFAZ01_SO01.Generic.18.0.0.2112.byol' in East US region.

`deploy.sh -n sophostest0 -l eastus -i https://where.is.your.vhd.bolb.stored/SFAZ01_SO01.Generic.18.0.0.2112.byol`

For more information about the deploy.sh, run `deploy.sh --help`.
